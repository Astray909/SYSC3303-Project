# SYSC3303-Project

This is the group project repo for "Group 5".
The goal of this project is to provide an implementation of an elevator control system and simulator.
The system consists of a scheduler, an elevator simulation algorithm, and a simulation of the floors.

## Prerequisites

* JavaSE-10 on JDK 13, although JDK 8 and later version should work as well
* Eclipse, the code is stored as an eclipse project
* Image viewer compatible with png format for UML diagrams

## Setup Instructions

* In Eclipse IDE, use Import Projects function to import the directory containing the project files
* Verify JRE System Library is set to jre-10 or higher
* Verify that all source files are placed in src directory
* Verify that a CSV input with the correct formatting is present
* Run the mainClass.java file as Java Application

## Testing Instructions
* In Eclipse IDE, inside the Package Explorer tab, expand test folder
* Right click on each JUnit Test File and run as JUnit Test to test corresponding classes
